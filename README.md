Visualization Markdown
  For my visializtions I have decided to highlight the most active bike stations for my given time frame.In addition, I have created a visualization that that shows the most common dates of birth that can show a target user. For the best start stations I have created a bar chart highlighting the top 10 stations. I have also done the same for end stations to compare to find a correlation.
